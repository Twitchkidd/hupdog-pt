# Hupdog Personal Training!

Discovery phase! First, it's Hupdog Personal Training, but Hupdog is what really needs to stick in the customer's mind, it's right there in the repo name, `hupdog-pt`

Wow, okay, moving on, specific copy Hupdog Personal Training (going back and forth on Hupdog or HupDog,) should definitely make some sort of 'building' joke. As far as mission, values, and emotions, let's see ...

## Core

### Mission

To boldy go ... no, wait ...

To inspire and uplift ... no, not that one either ...

To empower and uplift ... that's not bad, we can end that there for now ... oh, maybe something about caring deeply about the person's individuality ...

TBD

### Values

Science-based exercise prescription, while meeting the client where they're at in terms of knowledge and understanding, in order to serve most efficiently and effectively.

... That's not a value, that's a value proposition ... Here we go ...

We believe that anyone can take control of their own health and fitness, as much as anyone can. We believe that being authentic, fully present, and giving people respect are more important than being bubbly and over-the-top enthusiastic. We believe the people who would benefit the most from our help are people who are already facing difficulties, and we back that up with discounts and in our marketing.

### Emotions

We want to invoke hope and possibility, also confidence and simplicity. Maybe a little bit of fun, in the dad-joke thread of things.

## Market

Who's this for? Well, we can definitely help people with a variety of goals, such as weight loss, improved mobility, strength, endurance, power, hypertrophy, and cardiovascular health. Let's see, so, the overweight, the elderly or simply deconditioned, and athletes. And it doesn't require a gym, though obviously an airy, well lit space with a mirror and fitness equipment at the ready is advantageous, also just because having somewhere specific to _go_ to do a workout helps keep the practice regular.

So how does this affect design? Well, at each stage, ask ourselves how we'd see this each as a deconditioned, overweight, elderly, and athletic persons. We can probably assume ... well, actually, really what we can assume is that accessibility really needs to be a centrally considered element. I'm imagining clients with limited vision, or for whom using a screen is something they have to do in small bouts, so being able to get whatever done and move on is important. Ooo, and it might be viewed like, outside, so light mode by default, right?

## Design Tokens

Let's pick a font. Goodness, everyone seems to use blocky sans-serif. More blocky for titles, more web-friendly for text. Alright, Recursive by Arrow Type, Stephen Nixon, and Assistant by multiple designers for headers and body, respectively.
